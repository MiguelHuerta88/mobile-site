INSERT INTO `node_types` VALUES (1,1,'Welcome. I\'m a professional web developer with 2+ years experience. I\'m currently a Web Developer at Internet Brands working with all aspects of projects. At times I do front-end development, other times I work on the backend side of things.  My daily routine could include anything from deploy our sites using Jenkins and Git or developing a new feature for our sites. My skills include MySQL, PostgreSQL, JQuery, PHP and CSS. Other skills that I have learned while working at IB include Less and Coffeescript. Drupal and Wordpress are some Content Management Systems that I work on from time to time. Nothing major is done besides the usual upgrading to newer versions or upgrading plugins.Some of the frameworks that I\'m familiar with are Laravel, Lumen and CodeIgniter.\r\n\r\nI enjoy learning about new technologies and frameworks. I have read a few books on CodeIgniter and Laravel. The best feeling to me is struggling trying to solve a problem and then finally being able to solve it. Solving problems is something that I deal with on a daily basis at work. Being able to look at a solution to a previous problem and seeing if we could optimize it in any way possible is something I also enjoy doing. On my spare time I like keep up to date with the current technology changes that are occurring, reading documentation and staying up to date. Besides coding some of my other hobbies include cycling, skateboarding and running. My weekly goals are to ride my bike to work at least three times out of the week. \r\n\r\n               \r\n                \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            ','2015-12-27 09:12:56','2015-12-28 04:28:24'),(2,2,'                                        Some of my projects that I have worked on over the years.\r\n\r\n<span class=\'section-bold\' style=\'font-weight: bold;color:#ce2c27;font-size: 15px;\'>Software Engineering Project</span>\r\n\r\nDuring my Software Engineering course, we were given the assignment of creating an online system to simulate a bank. For this project I was the Website Administrator. My duties were to make sure that the site was running correctly at all times, go over code to check that it goes along with our guidelines, and help out my other group members with anything they needed. I took down the site once the course was over because it was not generating traffic. I still have all of the code save on file in case I ever want to put the site back up permanently.\r\n\r\n<span class=\'section-bold\' style=\'font-weight: bold;color:#ce2c27;font-size: 15px;\'>Senior Project</span>\r\n                \r\nFor my Senior Design Course at school, I developed a Java Application for managing gardening customers. My father has a gardening business and I wanted to design an application that will make managing his customers much easier. The application is standalone, which means that it can run on any computer as long as you have the Java runtime environment present. The application can add and delete customers. It can also search for any particular customer that is currently in the application at the time. There are two different ways to search, either by the address or by the owner name. The application can also view, and make payments to keep track of the monthly checks that arrive. Some of the more important functions are that the application can print monthly bills, along with envelope labels for the customers on evelope label paper. Finally you can also save and read in file that store all of the information that you added to the application. You can download the Jar file under the Download section \r\n\r\n <span class=\'section-bold\' style=\'font-weight: bold;color:#ce2c27;font-size: 15px;\'>IB Analytics Tool </span>\r\n\r\nAt my current internship I began developing a tool that would be used by all of the employees at the company. With the guidance of my manager I gathered my task that needed to be completed. The task at first were simple, but as more and more ideas began to be developed the project increased in difficulty. At the moment the project uses MySQL, PHP, jQuery, CSS and Javascript. The Analytics tool stores approximately 474 different sites that Internet Brands either owns or manages. Each site has a relationship to a parent Account. Many sites can have the same parent. The Accounts table just stores all of our accounts that are used for Google Analytics. This was my first task that I had to complete before moving forward.\r\n\r\nOnce, I had all the sites properly linked up to their appropriate Account I was able to begin gathering different Google Analytics Metrics. With the help of an open source PHP script named G.A.P.I (Google Analytics PHP Interface) I was able to begin gathering data quick. I gather about 24 different metrics which are gathered with a daily cron jobs that runs daily at around 12:30 pm. As the cron job runs each of the metrics are stored in another table name Traffic. The primary key for the traffic table is the siteId, and Date for which the row was inserted. Emails are also sent out daily based on how the site is doing based on both Monthly Standard deviation and Day of the Week Standard Deviation. A valid user mechanism was established that allows anyone in the company to click on a site and add themselves to the email list. These are some of the many features that the tool is capable of doing.\r\n\r\nThe users can also generate 4 different types of reports currently. They can either generate a Google Traffic comparison report. This report prompts the user for two valid date ranges and then spits out a table with the sum of google traffic per site for each range. Another column we also calculate the growth and percentage difference for the traffic. We finish the report off by summing up each site per vertical and displaying the same table with sum, growth and difference. Another report that is generated is a monthly dashboard report that the finance department previously generated using Excel. The report allows the user to select the range for the dashboard. In the backend we take those two dates and then calculate distinct months. We then get the starting and ending dates for each month and run a function towards the database to get our data back. The data we display is Visits, Monthly Pageviews, Unique Visitors, Mobile Visits, Tablet Visits and a few more metrics.\r\n\r\n<span class=\'section-bold\' style=\'font-weight: bold;color:#ce2c27;font-size: 15px;\'>Goodguysclassifieds API</span>  \r\n\r\nCreating an API using Lumen that is currently being used to downstream ads to <a href=\"//goodguysclassifieds.com\">Goodguysclassifieds.com</a> from <a href=\"//hotrodhotline.com\"> HotrodHotline</a> and <a href=\"//oldride.com\">OldRide</a>. While on any of those two sites we give the user the chance to downstream their ad to GoodguysClassifieds. If they select to downstream the ad then we have a daily cron running at around 2 am that makes API request to Goodguys to downstream the ads. We use Guzzle to make these request.\r\n\r\n<span class=\'section-bold\' style=\'font-weight: bold;color:#ce2c27;font-size: 15px;\'>Secure Payment</span>  \r\n\r\nAnother major project that we just completed was our Secure Payment Gateway for all of our sites in our Vertical. This project basically removes all credit card forms from all of our sites and instead makes API calls using Guzzle between our secure server and our origin site. It firsts contacts our secure server and if a successful response is returned then we encrypt all our data that will be passed. The user then gets redirected to our secure site where they will be greeted with a credit card form to enter their information. After a successful transaction takes place the secure site then makes a callback_success call telling our site to complete anything that needs to be done passing it back all the encrypted data. After we complete any work we send a successful response or failure. The API  will then redirect to our origin site confirmation page of display a 404 page and logging any failures    \r\n                \r\n                ','2015-12-27 09:14:32','2015-12-28 01:17:43'),(3,3,'                                                                Here are a few download.\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tr><th>Document Name</th><th>Link</th></tr><tr><td id=\'doc-title\'>Resume</td><td><a href=\"http://miguelhuerta.co.nf/documents/MiguelHuertaResumeDeveloper.pdf\" target=\"__blank\">View</a></td></tr><tr><td id=\'doc-title\'>Recommendation Letter</td><td><a href=\"http://miguelhuerta.co.nf/documents/RecommendationLetter.jpg\" target=\"__blank\">View</a></td></tr><tr><td id=\'doc-title\'>Visual Cryptography Research Paper</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://miguelhuerta.co.nf/documents/VisualCrypPaper.pdf\" target=\"__blank\">View</a></td></tr></table> \r\n            \r\n            ','2015-12-28 01:37:23','2015-12-29 02:20:00');
